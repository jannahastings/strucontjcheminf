  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The development of high-throughput experimentation has
	led to astronomical growth in biologically relevant lipids and lipid
	derivatives identified, screened, and deposited in numerous online
	databases. Unfortunately, efforts to annotate, classify, and analyze
	these chemical entities have largely remained in the hands of human
	curators using manual or semi-automated protocols, leaving many novel
	entities unclassified. Since chemical function is often closely linked
	to structure, accurate structure-based classification and annotation
	of chemical entities is imperative to understanding their functionality.RESULTS:As
	part of an exploratory study, we have investigated the utility of
	semantic web technologies in automated chemical classification and
	annotation of lipids. Our prototype framework consists of two components:
	an ontology and a set of federated web services that operate upon
	it. The formal lipid ontology we use here extends a part of the LiPrO
	ontology and draws on the lipid hierarchy in the LIPID MAPS database,
	as well as literature-derived knowledge. The federated semantic web
	services that operate upon this ontology are deployed within the
	Semantic Annotation, Discovery, and Integration (SADI) framework.
	Structure-based lipid classification is enacted by two core services.
	Firstly, a structural annotation service detects and enumerates relevant
	functional groups for a specified chemical structure. A second service
	reasons over lipid ontology class descriptions using the attributes
	obtained from the annotation service and identifies the appropriate
	lipid classification. We extend the utility of these core services
	by combining them with additional SADI services that retrieve associations
	between lipids and proteins and identify publications related to
	specified lipid types. We analyze the performance of SADI-enabled
	eicosanoid classification relative to the LIPID MAPS classification
	and reflect on the contribution of our integrative methodology in
	the context of high-throughput lipidomics. CONCLUSIONS:Our prototype
	framework is capable of accurate automated classification of lipids
	and facile integration of lipid class information with additional
	data obtained with SADI web services. The potential of programming-free
	integration of external web services through the SADI framework offers
	an opportunity for development of powerful novel applications in
	lipidomics. We conclude that semantic web technologies can provide
	an accurate and versatile means of classification and annotation
	of lipids.}},

<p>Among the existing systems capable of computationally comparing chemical compounds, the majority use only structural and physicochemical properties. However, with the emergence of ChEBI and other chemical compound databases, it has become feasible to create a system that can use the relevance of compounds in a biological context as well. This setting enables the distinction of molecules with different roles in nature but similar structures, or similar roles and different structures. ChEBI is organized as an ontology that classifies chemical compounds, which we use to derive a semantic similarity measure that reflects the biological relevance of molecules. In an effort to use as much information as possible, we introduce Chym, a system that integrates structural and semantic information in a single hybrid metric, and we show the accuracy of the system in three distinct classification problems, which consist in deciding whether a compound crosses the blood brain barrier, is a P-glycoprotein substrate or an estrogen receptor ligand. Chym outperforms the previous attempts to solve these three problems, with a maximum accuracy of 90.0%.</p>
